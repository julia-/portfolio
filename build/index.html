        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I’m a Full-Stack Web Developer with a fondness for the Front-End. I’m naturally inquisitive and get a kick out of figuring out how things work. I'm interested in visual design and making websites that are usable and accessible to all. I have an eye for detail so I'll spot that missing parenthesis!</p>
        <p>I’m looking to work with a creative and collaborative team to make beautiful, meaningful and functional web applications.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding or reading about code, I'm enjoy spending time with my family and friends, finding good coffee, listening to music, going to gigs and exhibitions.. and spending a little bit too much time playing Civilization. </p><i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"><span class="icon-text"> I completed General Assembly's Front-End Web Development course in March 2014</span></i><i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"><span class="icon-text"> I completed General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course in April 2015 </span></i><a href="doc/JuliaRyan-CV-2015-April.pdf" alt="Download CV" class="btn-cv">Download CV</a>

          <p>I designed and developed Historia for my final project during the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly, Sydney.</p>
          <p>Historia is a rails app that allows people to discover places around the world that they may not have known even existed. They can also find out about the history of the place through information pulled from Wikipedia using Wikipedia's API and see where the place is located using Google Maps API. People can sign up for an account to favourite or share a place. </p>
          <p>I also built a Chrome Extension which is not yet ready to download. The Chrome Extension overrides the default new tab and displays an image of a new place each time a new tab is opened.</p><i class="fa fa-globe"> <a href="https://historia-app.herokuapp.com/" alt="Historia">historia-app.herokuapp.com</a></i>

          <p>I worked with three classmates to design and develop Sparkr for our second project during the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly, Sydney.</p>
          <p>Sparkr is a dating service primarily for people over the age of 50 however open to anyone over 18. </p>
          <p>A user needs to like another user's three moments and vice versa for a match to occur. A users's three moments are to show aspects of the person's life - what they like and care about. Sparkr provides a place where they can start chatting once a match has occurred.</p><i class="fa fa-globe"> <a href="https://make-sparks-fly.herokuapp.com/" alt="Sparkr">make-sparks-fly.herokuapp.com</a></i>

          <p>I designed and developed 'I was there' for my first project during the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly, Sydney.</p>
          <p>Using Last.FM's API, users can search for artists and events to add or read reviews of the show.</p><i class="fa fa-globe"> <a href="https://i-was-there-app.herokuapp.com/" alt="I was there">i-was-there-app.herokuapp.com</a></i>
